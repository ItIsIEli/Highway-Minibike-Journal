Description: Gas mini bike with an electric display
Made: 6-16-2025

6-16-2025: Was mostly brainstorming on whether or not I wanted to make my own frame or purchase a used frame I decided that If I were to get a $100 used frame I could save time and use parts that are made for that frame.
I also did a quick rough scetch on the frame itself 
total time spent: 1hr 30 mins
