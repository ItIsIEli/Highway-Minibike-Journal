Description: Gas mini bike with an electric display
Made: 6-16-2025

6-16-2025: Was mostly brainstorming on whether or not I wanted to make my own frame or purchase a used frame I decided that If I were to get a $100 used frame I could save time and use parts that are made for that frame.
I also did a quick rough scetch on the frame itself ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e01b968-8a52-486e-8e54-078d08090c05)


Also started working on the display, which tells how fast youre going and distance. Im thinking to cut back on costs that Ill use the Rasberry Pi zero 2w I won from counterspell and a gmg12864-06d (lcd screen) which I already have for the display.
Now as to how the display actually works, there will be a small battery hidden somewhere in the frame that powers it. To track distance I will buy a hall efect probe and a magnet the magnet will be connected to the tire and the hall effect probe will be connected to the frame right in front of the wheel so every time the whel makes a rotation it gets tracked by the rasberry pi and displays how fast and what distance. An animation I made explains it.![My Project6-16-2025_10-40-46](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99205663-5452-4694-82e8-07371c936884)
